The relationship between these two deserves some attention.</p><p><code>Inconstant_idents</code> is a &quot;backwards&quot; analysis that propagates implications about inconstantness of variables and set of closures IDs.</p><p><code>Alias_analysis</code> is a &quot;forwards&quot; analysis that is analogous to the propagation of <code>Simple_value_approx.t</code> values during <code>Inline_and_simplify</code>. It gives us information about relationships between values but not actually about their constantness.</p><p>Combining these two into a single pass has been attempted previously, but was not thought to be successful; this experiment could be repeated in the future. (If &quot;constant&quot; is considered as &quot;top&quot; and &quot;inconstant&quot; is considered as &quot;bottom&quot;, then <code>Alias_analysis</code> corresponds to a least fixed point and <code>Inconstant_idents</code> corresponds to a greatest fixed point.)</p><p>At a high level, this pass operates as follows. Symbols are assigned to variables known to be constant and their defining expressions examined. Based on the results of <code>Alias_analysis</code>, we simplify the destructive elements within the defining expressions (specifically, projection of fields from blocks), to eventually yield <code>Flambda.constant_defining_value</code>s that are entirely constructive. These will be bound to symbols in the resulting program.</p><p>Another approach to this pass could be to only use the results of <code>Inconstant_idents</code> and then repeatedly lift constants and run <code>Inline_and_simplify</code> until a fixpoint. It was thought more robust to instead use <code>Alias_analysis</code>, where the fixpointing involves a less complicated function.</p><p>We still run <code>Inline_and_simplify</code> once after this pass since the lifting of constants may enable more functions to become closed; the simplification pass provides an easy way of cleaning up (e.g. making sure <code>free_vars</code> maps in sets of closures are correct).</p></header><div class="odoc-content"><div class="odoc-spec"><div class="spec value anchored" id="val-lift_constants"><a href="#val-lift_constants" class="anchor"></a><code><span><span class="keyword">val</span> lift_constants :
