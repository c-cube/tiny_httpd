(** Middleware for compression.

    This uses camlzip to provide deflate compression/decompression. If
    installed, the middleware will compress responses' bodies when they are
    streams or fixed-size above a given limit (but it will not compress small,
    fixed-size bodies). *)

val middleware :
  ?compress_above:int -> ?buf_size:int -> unit -> Server.Middleware.t
(** Middleware responsible for deflate compression/decompression.
    @param compress_above
      threshold, in bytes, above which a response body that has a known
      content-length is compressed. Stream bodies are always compressed.
    @param buf_size size of the underlying buffer for compression/decompression
    @since 0.11 *)

val setup : ?compress_above:int -> ?buf_size:int -> Server.t -> unit
(** Install middleware for tiny_httpd to be able to encode/decode compressed
    streams
    @param compress_above threshold above with string responses are compressed
    @param buf_size size of the underlying buffer for compression/decompression
*)
