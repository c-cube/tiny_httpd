  "CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole  Alice was beginning to get very tired of \
   sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or \
   twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no \
   pictures or conversations in it, <and what is the use of a book,> thought \
   Alice <without pictures or conversations?> So she was considering in her \
   own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy \
   and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth \
   the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White \
   Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so very \
   remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to \
   hear the Rabbit say to itself, <Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!> (when \
   she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have \
   wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when \
   the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at \
   it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across \
   her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a \
   waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, \
   she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see \
   it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge. In another moment down \
   went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get \
   out again. The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and \
   then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think \
   about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep \
   well. Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had \
   plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was \
   going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she \
   was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the \
   sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards......"
